# Accessible SVG Maps

Working example: http://examples.simplyaccessible.com/svg-maps/

The examples you see here are experimental. Sometimes they’re broken intentionally. Most times they exist to demonstrate a single point. In all cases, they’re not production ready, so for goodness sake don’t actually use without thoroughly testing them!
